# machine_learning_project - Movie Recommendations system
I took 2 csv file credits and movies from the TMDB which contain details of 5000 movies  and merge two csv file.
I cleaned the data set and calculate the cosine_similarity  with each word of one movie to anothe movie.
After that i used streamlit frameworks to build it's web interface and successful we can search name of movie.
and when we click on recommendation it recommends 5 best movies which is nearly similar to that movie which you watched.
